<h3><img align="right" alt="emsculpt neo" src="https://i.imgur.com/G70KA2L.jpg" style="box-sizing: border-box; vertical-align: middle; border-style: none; max-width: 36%; color: rgb(88, 88, 88); font-family: Poppins, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; letter-spacing: 1px; width: auto; height: auto; margin: 0px 10px; max-height: 292px;" /></h3>

<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: rgb(88, 88, 88); font-family: Poppins, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; letter-spacing: 1px;">EMSculpt Neo is a new fat reduction treatment that has proven to be an effective method for both men and women. It can help you to get rid of unwanted fat from your body in an affordable and painless way. This procedure is also suitable for a wider range of patients, which means you can be sure to find a solution that suits you.</p>

<h2 style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; line-height: 1.5; font-size: 1.4em; font-family: Poppins, sans-serif; color: var(--iq-title-text); letter-spacing: 1px;">Fat reduction</h2>

<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: rgb(88, 88, 88); font-family: Poppins, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; letter-spacing: 1px;">Using a combination of radio frequency (RF) and electromagnetic pulses, Emsculpt Neo is an effective method for fat reduction and muscle toning. It is also non-invasive, painless, and offers a comfortable recovery process.</p>

<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: rgb(88, 88, 88); font-family: Poppins, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; letter-spacing: 1px;">During an Emsculpt NEO treatment, RF energy is used to heat subcutaneous and visceral fat. The body's natural processes break down these fat cells, leaving behind a thin, more defined appearance.</p>

<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: rgb(88, 88, 88); font-family: Poppins, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; letter-spacing: 1px;">The procedure can be applied to many areas of the body, including the buttocks, thighs, calves, and upper arms. Results can be noticeable within a few weeks. However, the final results will take two to three months.</p>

<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: rgb(88, 88, 88); font-family: Poppins, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; letter-spacing: 1px;">The HIFEM+ technology in the EMSculpt NEO applicator creates supramaximal contractions that increase muscle fibers. This is achieved through a high intensity of the RF energy.</p>

<h2 style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; line-height: 1.5; font-size: 1.4em; font-family: Poppins, sans-serif; color: var(--iq-title-text); letter-spacing: 1px;">Muscle gain</h2>

<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: rgb(88, 88, 88); font-family: Poppins, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; letter-spacing: 1px;">EMSCULPT NEO (r) is a non-invasive body shaping method that uses high-intensity electromagnetic energies to stimulate muscle contractions and fat reduction. Unlike other methods, this process works by heating up the subcutaneous fat below the skin and causing controlled cell death.</p>

<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: rgb(88, 88, 88); font-family: Poppins, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; letter-spacing: 1px;">The procedure uses radiofrequency (RF) energy to heat the muscles in less than four minutes. After treatment, the patient's body begins to break down fat cells, which are then flushed out by the lymphatic system. This process results in the destruction of excess fat, and the formation of new, leaner muscle.</p>

<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: rgb(88, 88, 88); font-family: Poppins, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; letter-spacing: 1px;">The EMSCULPT NEO system can be used to sculpt different parts of the body, such as the stomach, the arms, and the buttocks. Patients with a BMI of up to 35 can take advantage of this non-invasive body shaping method.<img alt="emsculpt nyc" src="https://i.imgur.com/G70KA2L.jpg" style="width: 425px; height: 393px; float: right;" /></p>

<h2 style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; line-height: 1.5; font-size: 1.4em; font-family: Poppins, sans-serif; color: var(--iq-title-text); letter-spacing: 1px;">Pain-free treatment</h2>

<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: rgb(88, 88, 88); font-family: Poppins, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; letter-spacing: 1px;">EMsculpt Neo is a revolutionary non-invasive treatment that combines fat burning with muscle toning. It can be used on a variety of areas including the stomach, arms, buttocks, and calves.</p>

<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: rgb(88, 88, 88); font-family: Poppins, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; letter-spacing: 1px;">The main benefits of the treatment are its pain-free, non-invasive, and fast results. The procedure consists of a handpiece that emits high-intensity, focused electromagnetic waves. These waves cause intense muscle contractions, which help to remove excess fatty tissue and improve skin tightening. The treatment can last for as little as 30 minutes depending on the area being treated.</p>

<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: rgb(88, 88, 88); font-family: Poppins, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; letter-spacing: 1px;">The process also increases blood flow, which may increase waste elimination. Lastly, the treatment is painless, and the only side effect that qualified patients experience is mild to moderate soreness.</p>

<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: rgb(88, 88, 88); font-family: Poppins, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; letter-spacing: 1px;">The process can be performed on both men and women. It is not recommended for pregnant women or those with metal implants.</p>

<h2 style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; line-height: 1.5; font-size: 1.4em; font-family: Poppins, sans-serif; color: var(--iq-title-text); letter-spacing: 1px;">Aftercare</h2>

<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: rgb(88, 88, 88); font-family: Poppins, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; letter-spacing: 1px;"><strong>EMSculpt Neo</strong> is a non-invasive procedure that uses radio frequency energy to reduce the amount of fat in your body. The treatment is designed to burn off excess fat while also toning muscles, which results in a more lean physique. The technology is used to target areas of the body that are resistant to other methods of body sculpting.</p>

<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: rgb(88, 88, 88); font-family: Poppins, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; letter-spacing: 1px;">EMSculpt Neo works by heating up the targeted muscles, which causes apoptosis (permanent destruction) of the fat cells. This leads to more effective results than standalone treatments.</p>

The quickest results will occur after the first treatment, but the final results will take at least two months to see. After the first treatment, patients may notice some mild tenderness and redness in the area where the EmSculpt Neo is being applied. However, these minor discomforts will subside within an hour.</p>
